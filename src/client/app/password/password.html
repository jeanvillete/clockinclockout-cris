            <h3>Request for changing password</h3>
            <p>The process to reset password constitutes the following steps</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Through this screen, on the button bellow, click 'Reset password' and submit the request.</li>
                <li>An email is going to arrieve on your inbox, in order to ensure you really want to proceed.</li>
                <li>As soon you click the confirmation link, you are going to be redirected to here again, but to a specific screen where you will provide the new password you want to change to.</li>
            </ol>
            <cite>
                Note:
                <smal>Your password is going to be changed only after the entire process mentioned above is successfully completed,
                also bear in mind that each requesting for reset (to receive the email confirmation) is valid through a period of 30 minutes and is one shot,
                so if you loose the time range or something wrong happens for the first try, maybe it's better you start the process again.
